        from_bucket: str) -> date | None`` (see
        defaults.propose_transfer_best_by). When given, each dated entry's
        best-by is rewritten to the proposal before its transfer, so freezing

        get re-bucketed by the default-location change; their previous storage
        kind is unknowable, so their dates are honestly left alone.

        Grocy compacts stock after every date write (see _fresh_entry), so no
        step here trusts a list read before a write. Each pass re-reads the
        entries, dates the row it is about to move, and transfers exactly one
        whole row by its stock id. Grocy's transfer takes a stock id, not a
        row id: when several rows at the source share one (splits and merges
        leave them behind), it takes them opened first, then earliest due
        first. So every row sharing the id gets its new date before anything
        moves, and the transfer names the amount of the row Grocy takes first.

        A merged row carries one date, so the proposal has to be idempotent,
        as propose_transfer_best_by is: asked about a date it proposed, it
        proposes nothing new. A proposal that shifts every date by a fixed

    Grocy prints "grcy:p:{product_id}" for a product and
    "grcy:p:{product_id}:{stock_id}" for one exact stock entry (the stock id is
    Grocy's short alphanumeric hash for that entry, e.g. "6a28c889c1193");

    pair with stock_entry_id == "" for the product-only form, or None for
    anything that is not a well-formed product grocycode (other entity kinds
    like chores, junk ids, extra segments), so a caller can fall back to normal
    barcode handling instead of acting on garbage. Never raises.
